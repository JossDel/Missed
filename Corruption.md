# Corruption

Corruption  has 500 points in total.

The player starts with 0 and accumulates it in 3 ways. Being in the mist, sometimes getting hit by enemies and dying.

Corruption is healed by light sources you find after killing enemies

Every 100 points of corruption there is a level. Each level of corruption adds a debuff to the player on damage output and total health

If the player reaches level 5 of corruption (or 500 points) it's game over.
